# 🪐 Planet Weight Converter (C++)

A simple C++ console application that converts your weight on Earth to your weight on another planet in our solar system. This project is part of my journey to strengthen my C++ skills and demonstrate input validation, arithmetic operations, and user interaction in a console environment.

## 🛠️ What It Does
- Prompts the user to enter their weight as measured on Earth.
- Validates the input to ensure it's a positive number.
- Presents a menu to select a planet by number (1–7): Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
- Converts the user's Earth weight to the equivalent weight on the selected planet using the appropriate gravity multiplier.
- Displays the result to the user.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio).
2. Run the executable in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
- C++ basics: variables, input/output, conditionals, loops, switch statements
- Input validation
- Console application structure

## 📚 Why This Project?
This project helps reinforce my understanding of C++ syntax and best practices, while also providing a fun and educational tool to explore how gravity varies across the solar system.  
It's a revised practice exercise from a Codecademy tutorial.
