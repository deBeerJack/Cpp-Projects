# 🐶 Dog Age Converter (C++)

A simple C++ console application to convert a dog's age in dog years to human years. This project is part of my journey to strengthen my C++ skills and demonstrate basic input validation, arithmetic operations, and user interaction in a console environment.

## 🛠️ What It Does
- Prompts the user to enter their dog's name and age (between 2 and 25 years).
- Validates the input to ensure it's a number within the allowed range.
- Converts the dog's age to human years using the formula:  
  - First 2 years = 21 human years  
  - Each additional year = 4 human years
- Displays the result to the user.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio).
2. Run the executable in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
- C++ basics: variables, input/output, conditionals, loops
- Input validation
- Console application structure

## 📚 Why This Project?
This project helps reinforce my understanding of C++ syntax and best practices, while also providing a practical tool for pet owners and a fun way to practice programming fundamentals.  
It's a revised practice exercise from a Codecademy tutorial.
