# 📏 Distance Converter (C++)

A simple C++ console application that converts distances from miles to kilometers. This project is part of my journey to strengthen my C++ skills and demonstrate input validation, arithmetic operations, and user interaction in a console environment.

## 🛠️ What It Does
- Prompts the user to enter a distance in miles.
- Validates the input to ensure it's a positive number.
- Converts the distance from miles to kilometers using the formula: kilometers = miles / 1.6.
- Displays the result to the user.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio).
2. Run the executable in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
- C++ basics: variables, input/output, conditionals, loops
- Input validation
- Console application structure

## 📚 Why This Project?
This project helps reinforce my understanding of C++ syntax and best practices, while also providing a practical tool for quick distance conversions.  
It's a revised practice exercise from a Codecademy tutorial.
